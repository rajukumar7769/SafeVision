Object Detection model using yolov8
Object detection is a technology to detect various objects in digital images and videos too. 
It is mainly helpful within the self- driving cars, face detection, etc., where the objects are 
to be continuously monitored. The algorithm or the technique involved for object detection during 
this project is Convolutional Neural Networks which is a class of Deep learning. 

This uses MobileNet SSD technique during which MobileNet is a neural network used for image
classification and recognition whereas SSD is a framework that is used to realize the multibox
detector. The mixture of both MobileNet and SSD can do object detection. The main advantage
or purpose of choosing Deep learning is that we do not need to do feature extraction from data
as compared to machine learning. The Haar-like trait play a crucial role in detecting the objects
in a picture. They scan the entire picture starting from the top left and compares every small
box with the trained data. In this way, even small-detailed objects present within the images
are identified.

Project Objective:
To build to Object detection that object physically as well as Visually.
To reduce accidents.
It attaches with any vehicles and sense object.
It is portable to use.
